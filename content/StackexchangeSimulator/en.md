You may know [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/), a network of Question-and-Answer sites around every imaginable topic. All content generated on the site is licensed under [Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and can be downloaded as [a complete database dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange).

I wanted to program something that uses a huge amount of data, so this is an ideal source.

Stackexchange Simulator uses Markov Chains based on the database dumps to generate nonsense questions and corresponding answers. Visitors can then vote on them so that the most entertaining ones get on the front page.

In addition, one can [filter](https://se-simulator.lw1.at/s/unix.stackexchange.com) for sites and there is [a quiz](https://se-simulator.lw1.at/quiz/easy) where one can guess which StackExchange site a question is based on.

### Success

After beeing on the frontpage of [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16947038) for 24 hours and getting [mentioned by Jeff Atwood](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/990479352570638337) more than 7500 people have visited the site.
