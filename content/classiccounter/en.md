> No website is complete without an old-school visitor counter!

This Matomo plugin generates a SVG file showing the total number of website visits. This image can then simply be embedded into a website from the URL like `https://matomo.lw1.at/index.php?module=ClassicCounter&action=svg&idSite=14`. To avoid high server load the image gets regenerated and cached every hour.

Download it from [the Matomo Marketplace](https://plugins.matomo.org/ClassicCounter) and try it out!
