After the [first rainbow crossroad](Regenbogen-Zebrastreifen) in Austria has been drawn in 2019, more and more of them added in all parts of Vienna and the rest auf Austria.

*Rainbow Road* tries to collect the location of all rainbow crossroads in Austria on a map. The [data set](https://github.com/Findus23/RainbowRoad/tree/main/data) is not yet complete, but hints about missing entries are always welcome!
