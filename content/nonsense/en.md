A well-known Swedish furniture store had a website listing all their products with a short description.

## Technical Details
The pseudo-swedish names are generated with a second-order [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain),
while the descriptions are shuffeled nouns and adjectives with linking words between them.
