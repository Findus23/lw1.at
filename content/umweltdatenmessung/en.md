In 2014 in a project lasting many months I tried to connect as many sensors (temperature, humidity, air pressure, air quality) as possible to a Raspberry Pi hanging in the class room. The data is saved and displayed live on [a display](https://vwa.lw1.at/images/display.jpg) and a website. The website also shows historical data.

A copy of this site with more details on the project can still be found on [vwa.lw1.at](https://vwa.lw1.at/).

In July 2014 I presented the project in front of a jury in the final of the [*computer creative contest*](http://blog.ocg.at/2014/06/ccw14-final/) by the Austrian Computer Society and won the first place in my age group.

On October 6. 2014 I had the chance to give a presentation in front of a workgroup at the *IKT-Konvent*, the annual meeting of all Austrian ISPs.

In the following months I wrote [my *Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit*](https://github.com/Findus23/VWA/raw/master/main.pdf) ("pre-scientific thesis"), which was 2015 for the first time a part of the Austrian high school finals, about this project.
