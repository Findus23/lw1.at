This is an experiment of building a more lightweight variant of matomo.js by removing rarely used features and support for old browsers.

Keep in mind this is:

* experimental: I can't guarantee that it will work as expected
* inofficial: This is not officially maintained by the Matomo team
* incomplete: See below.

That said, if you are interested in trying it out, I'd be interested in hearing your feedback.
