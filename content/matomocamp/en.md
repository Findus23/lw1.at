In early 2021 [Ronan](https://ronan-chardonneau.fr/) contacted me to ask if I was interested in the idea of an open source
conference centered solely around [Matomo](https://matomo.org). I was intrigued and over the following months we got 
[a team](https://matomocamp.org/about-the-team/) of Matomo experts from all over Europe together who would be interested
in contributing. After [a public survey](https://matomocamp.org/news/survey-results-and-decisions-for-the-matomocamp-organization/)
to gauge interest, we settled on a date (November the 4th and 5th 2021) and started the actual planning of the event.
Thanks to the involvement of the rest of the team and a public call for participation we finally got 28 talks and workshops
by 25 speakers from 11 different countries. 

Thanks to the sponsorship by [empreinte digitale](https://empreintedigitale.fr/) we were able to achieve our goal of 
executing the online conference using only free and open source software. They hosted a [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org) server,
a [matrix.org](https:/matrix.org) chat platform and a live streaming server which combined with a [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/) instance
hosted and [customized](https://github.com/MatomoCamp/pretalx-matomocamp) by me provided everything needed for the conference.
In addition a minimal and very fast [flask webapp](https://github.com/MatomoCamp/live-platform) combined all of these platforms
into one userfriendly UI.

All talks were recorded and in the weeks after the event edited and uploaded to [video.matomocamp.org](https://video.lw1.at)
where they are still availible.

**Many thanks to everyone for making this the best Matomo conference so far!**

If you are interested in the technical details of the Matomocamp setup, feel free to contact me.
