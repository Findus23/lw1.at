> easily generating invoices with LaTeX

Sounds impossible, but it isn't! While manually editing templates every time you need to issue an invoice gets boring soon, one can use the power of [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) to dynamically generate LaTeX similar to HTML. That way one can create nice invoices in a few minutes.

While the invoice template fulfilly my needs, the basic idea can be applied to many other issues.
