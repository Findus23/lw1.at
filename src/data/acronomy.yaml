  > because Astronomers love Acronyms

  [Acronomy](https://acronomy.lw1.at/) is a collection of astronomical acronyms, their meaning and
  links to resources to learn more about them.

  In addition there is a Browser and KDE-Plasma [integration](https://acronomy.lw1.at/integrations)
  to quickly look up the meaning of acronyms when stumbling across them in a text.

  The website is a work-in-progress with more features, acronyms and integrations being added over time.
